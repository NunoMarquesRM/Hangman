Hangman Game - Art Module

This module contains the ASCII art used in the Hangman game.
It provides two main components:
1. stages: A list of ASCII art representations showing the hangman's progression
2. logo: The game's ASCII art logo

The stages list contains 7 different states of the hangman (0-6 lives remaining),
with each state showing more of the hangman figure as lives are lost.
